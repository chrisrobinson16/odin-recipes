    <h4>Fries:</h4>
    <p> This is the best fries recipe that you can ever have. </p>
    <p>No fries will match this recipe.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Potatoes</li>
        <li> Cooking Oil</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon celery salt</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons paprika</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps for fries</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop the potatoes.
            To prepare this easy recipe, you need to make sure that they are cut in the right shape and size. They should neither be too thick, nor too thin and should be cut clean and sharp. The trick is to first slice the potatoes and then cut them lengthwise. You can also use a fries cutter for that long, even shape.</li>
            <li> Soak cut potatoes in ice-cold water for 10-15 minutes
            now, wash the potatoes under running water till they are squeaky clean. Place them in a bowl of iced water for 10 to 15 minutes. Keep them submerged in water or they will turn.</li>
            <li>Deep fry the potato fries
            now, heat the oil in a deep bottomed pan. Once the smoke starts appearing, reduce the flame and allow it to acquire a lower temperature. Now, deep fry the potatoes in batches. Keep the flame low. This will make them crunchy and also help retain their flavor.</li>
            <li>Step 4 Sprinkle seasoning mix and serve hot
            Drain excess oil and place them on an absorbent paper. Allow them to cool. Now sprinkle salt and pepper and toss well. Serve immediately with ketchup. They can also be served with burgers and cutlets.</li>
    </ol>
